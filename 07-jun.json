    "body":  "After some time in recovery, we may find we are faced with what seem like overwhelming personal problems, angry feelings, and despair. When we realize what\u0027s going on, we may wail, \"But I\u0027ve been working so hard. I thought I was...\" Recovered, maybe? Not hardly. Over and over, we hear that recovery is an ongoing process and that we are never cured. Yet we sometimes believe that if we just work our steps enough, pray enough, or go to enough meetings, we\u0027ll eventually . . . Well, maybe not be cured, but be something!And we are \"something.\" We\u0027re recovering--recovering from active addiction. No matter what we\u0027ve dealt with through the process of the steps, there will always be more. What we didn\u0027t remember or didn\u0027t think was important in our first inventory will surely present itself later on. Again and again, we\u0027ll turn to the process of the steps to deal with what\u0027s bothering us. The more we use this process the more we\u0027ll trust it, for we can see the results. We go from anger and resentment to forgiveness, from denial to honesty and acceptance, and from pain to serenity.Recovery doesn\u0027t happen overnight, and ours will never be complete. But each day brings new healing and the hope for more tomorrow.",
