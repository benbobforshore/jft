    "body":  "We addicts are a varied bunch, coming from different backgrounds, having used different drugs, and recalling different experiences. Our differences don\u0027t disappear in recovery; for some, those differences become even more pronounced. Freedom from active addiction gives us the freedom to be ourselves, as we truly are. The fact that we are all recovering doesn\u0027t mean that we all necessarily have the same needs or goals. Each of us has our own lessons to learn in recovery.With so many differences from one addict to the next, how do we help one another in recovery and how do we use each other\u0027s experience? We come together to share our lives in light of the principles of recovery. Though our lives are different, the spiritual principles we apply are the same. It is by the light of these principles, shining through our differences, that we illuminate one another\u0027s way on our individual paths.We all have two things in common: addiction and recovery. When we listen carefully, we hear others tell of suffering from the same disease we have suffered from, regardless of their specific backgrounds. When we open our ears, we hear other addicts talk of applying spiritual principles that promise hope to us as well, regardless of our personal goals.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will have my own path to follow, yet I\u0027m grateful for the fellowship of others who\u0027ve suffered from addiction and who are learning to apply the principles of recovery, just like me.",
