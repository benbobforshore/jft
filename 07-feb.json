    "body":  "Some of us come into recovery with the impression that life\u0027s hardships are a series of cosmic tests designed to teach us something. This belief is readily apparent when something traumatic happens and we wail, \"My Higher Power is testing me!\" We\u0027re convinced that it\u0027s a test of our recovery when someone offers us drugs, or a test of our character when faced with a situation where we could do something unprincipled without getting caught. We may even think it\u0027s a test of our faith when we\u0027re in great pain over a tragedy in our lives. But a loving Higher Power doesn\u0027t test our recovery, our character, or our faith. Life just happens, and sometimes it hurts. Many of us have lost love through no fault of our own. Some of us have lost all of our material wealth. A few of us have even grieved the loss of our own children. Life can be terribly painful at times, but the pain is not inflicted on us by our Higher Power. Rather, that Power is constantly by our sides, ready to carry us if we can\u0027t walk by ourselves. There is no harm that life can do us that the God of our understanding can\u0027t heal.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will have faith that my Higher Power\u0027s will for me is good, and that I am loved. I will seek my Higher Power\u0027s help in times of need.",
