    "body":  "Sometimes it seems as if our recovery is growing much too slowly. We struggle with the steps; we wrestle with the same problems; we labor under the same uncomfortable feelings day after day. We wish that recovery would move a little faster so we could find some comfort!Wishing doesn\u0027t work in recovery; this isn\u0027t a program of magic. If wishes cured addiction, we all would have been well long ago! What does give us relief in recovery is action and prayer.Narcotics Anonymous has worked for so many addicts because it is a carefully designed program of action and prayer. The actions we undertake in each of the steps bring more and more recovery to each area of our lives. And prayer keeps us connected to our Higher Power. Together, action and prayer keep us well-grounded in recovery.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: My recovery is too precious to just wish about it. Today is a good day for action and prayer.",
