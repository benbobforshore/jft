    "body":  "Complete defeat--what a concept! That must mean surrender. Surrender--to give up absolutely. To quit with no reservations. To put up our hands and quit fighting. Maybe to put up our hand at our first meeting and admit we\u0027re addicts. How do we know we\u0027ve taken a First Step that will allow us to live drug-free? We know because, once we have taken that gigantic step, we never have to use again--just for today. That\u0027s it. It\u0027s not easy, but it\u0027s very simple. We work the First Step. We accept that, yes, we are addicts. \"One is too many, and a thousand never enough.\" We\u0027ve proven that to ourselves enough times. We admit that we cannot handle drugs in any form. We admit it; we say it out loud, if necessary. We take the First Step at the beginning of our day. For one day. This admission frees us, just for today, from the need to live out our addiction all over again. We\u0027ve surrendered to this disease. We give up. We quit. But in quitting, we win. And that\u0027s the paradox of the First Step: We surrender to win, and by surrendering we gain a far greater power than we ever imagined possible.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I admit that I am powerless over my addiction. I will surrender to win.",
