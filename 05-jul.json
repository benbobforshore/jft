    "body":  "From time to time, we all experience conflicts. It may be that we just can\u0027t get along with that new co-worker. Maybe our friends are driving us crazy. Or perhaps our partner isn\u0027t living up to our expectations. Dealing with any conflict is difficult for recovering addicts.When tempers rise, it is often a good idea to back away from the situation until cooler minds prevail. We can always return to further discussion when we have calmed down. We can\u0027t avoid troubling situations, but we can use time and distance to find perspective.Conflict is a part of life. We can\u0027t go through our entire recovery without encountering disagreements and differences of opinion.  Sometimes we can back away from these situations, taking time to reflect on them, but there always comes a time when conflict must be resolved. When that time comes, we take a deep breath, say a prayer, and apply the principles our program has given us: honesty, openness, responsibility, forgiveness, trust, and all the rest. We didn\u0027t get clean to keep running from life--and in recovery, we don\u0027t have to run anymore.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: The principles my program has given me are sufficient to guide me through any situation. I will strive to confront conflict in a healthy way.",
