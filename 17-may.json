    "body":  "The Twelve Steps are a path to spiritual awakening. This awakening takes the form of a developing relationship with a loving Higher Power. Each succeeding step strengthens that relationship. As we continue to work the steps, the relationship grows, becoming ever more important in our lives. In the course of working the steps, we make a personal decision to allow a loving Higher Power to direct us. That guidance is always available; we need only the patience to seek it. Often, that guidance manifests itself in the inner wisdom we call our conscience. When we open our hearts wide enough to sense our Higher Power\u0027s guidance, we feel a calm serenity. This peace is the beacon that guides us through our troubled feelings, providing clear direction when our minds are busy and confused. When we seek and follow God\u0027s will in our lives, we find the contentment and joy that often elude us when we strike out on our own. Fear or doubt may plague us when we attempt to carry out our Higher Power\u0027s will, but we\u0027ve learned to trust the moment of clarity. Our greatest happiness lies in following the will of our loving God.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will seek to strengthen my relationship with my Higher Power. I know from experience that knowledge of my Higher Power\u0027s will provides a sense of clarity, direction, and peace.",
