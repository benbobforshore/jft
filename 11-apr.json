    "body":  "After putting some clean time together, some of us have a tendency to forget what our most important priority is. Once a week or less we say, \"I\u0027ve gotta get to a meeting tonight. It\u0027s been...\" We\u0027ve been caught up in other things, important for sure, but no more so than our continued participation in Narcotics Anonymous. It happens gradually. We get jobs. We reunite with our families. We\u0027re raising children, the dog is sick, or we\u0027re going to school at night. The house needs to be cleaned. The lawn needs to be mowed. We have to work late. We\u0027re tired. There\u0027s a good show at the theater tonight. And all of a sudden, we notice that we haven\u0027t called our sponsor, been to a meeting, spoken to a newcomer, or even talked to God in quite a while. What do we do at this point? Well, we either renew our commitment to our recovery, or we continue being too busy to recover until something happens and our lives become unmanageable. Quite a choice! Our best bet is to put more of our energy into maintaining the foundation of recovery on which our lives are built. That foundation makes everything else possible, and it will surely crumble if we get too busy with everything else.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I can\u0027t afford to be too busy to recover. I will do something today that sustains my recovery.",
