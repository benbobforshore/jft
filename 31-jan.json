    "body":  "Learning to trust is a risky proposition. Our past experience as using addicts has taught us that our companions could not be trusted. Most of all, we couldn\u0027t trust ourselves. Now that we\u0027re in recovery, trust is essential. We need something to hang onto, believe in, and give us hope in our recovery. For some of us, the first thing we can trust is the words of other members sharing in meetings; we feel the truth in their words. Finding someone we can trust makes it easier to ask for help. And as we grow to trust in their recovery, we learn to trust our own.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will decide to trust someone. I will act on that trust.",
