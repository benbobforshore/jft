    "reference":  "Tradition Twelve",
    "body":  "The Twelfth Tradition reminds us of the importance of putting \"principles before personalities.\" In recovery meetings, this might be paraphrased, \"don\u0027t shoot the messenger.\" We often get the message confused with the messenger, and negate what someone shares at a meeting because we have personality conflicts with the person speaking. If we are having problems with what certain people have to share at meetings, we might want to seek the guidance of our sponsor. Our sponsor can help us concentrate on what\u0027s being said rather than who\u0027s saying it. Our sponsor can also help us address the resentments that may be keeping us from acknowledging the value of some particular person\u0027s recovery experience. It is surprising how much more we can get out of meetings when we allow ourselves to do as our Twelfth Tradition suggests, focusing on recovery principles rather than personalities.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will practice the principle of anonymity in today\u0027s NA meeting. I will focus on the message of recovery, not the personality of the messenger.",
