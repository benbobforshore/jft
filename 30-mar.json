    "body":  "It\u0027s human nature to want something for nothing. We may be ecstatic when a store cashier gives us back change for a twenty though we only paid with a ten. We tend to think that, if no one knows, one small deception won\u0027t make any difference. But someone does know--we do. And it does make a difference. What worked for us when we used frequently doesn\u0027t work long in recovery. As we progress spiritually by working the Twelve Steps, we begin to develop new values and standards. We begin to feel uncomfortable when we take advantage of situations that, when we used, would have left us gloating about what we had gotten away with. In the past, we may have victimized others. However, as we draw closer to our Higher Power, our values change. God\u0027s will becomes more important than getting away with something. When our values change, our lives change, too. Guided by an inner knowledge given us by our Higher Power, we want to live out our newfound values. We have internalized our Higher Power\u0027s will for us--in fact, God\u0027s will has become our own true will for ourselves.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: By improving my conscious contact with God, my values have changed. Today, I will practice God\u0027s will, my own true will.",
