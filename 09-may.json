    "body":  "In a way, addiction is a great teacher. And if addiction teaches us nothing else, it will teach us humility. We hear it said that it took our very best thinking to get to NA. Now that we\u0027re here, we\u0027re here to learn. The NA Fellowship is a wonderful learning environment for the recovering addict. We aren\u0027t made to feel stupid at meetings. Instead, we find others who\u0027ve been exactly where we\u0027ve been and who\u0027ve found a way out. All we have to do is admit that we don\u0027t have all the answers, then listen as others share what\u0027s worked for them. As recovering addicts and as human beings, we have much to learn. Other addicts--and other humans--have much to teach us about what works and what doesn\u0027t. As long as we remain teachable, we can take advantage of the experience of others.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will admit that I don\u0027t have all the answers. I will look and listen to the experience of others for the answers I need.",
