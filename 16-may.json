    "body":  "Most of us are terrified to look at ourselves, to probe our insides. We\u0027re afraid that if we examine our actions and motives, we\u0027ll find a bottomless black pit of selfishness and hatred. But as we take the Fourth Step, we\u0027ll find that those fears were unwarranted. We\u0027re human, just like everyone else--no more, no less. We all have personality traits that we\u0027re not especially proud of. On a bad day, we may think that our faults are worse than anyone else\u0027s. We\u0027ll have moments of self-doubt. We\u0027ll question our motives. We may even question our very existence. But if we could read the minds of our fellow members, we\u0027d find the same struggles. We\u0027re no better or worse than anyone else. We can only change what we acknowledge and understand. Rather than continuing to fear what\u0027s buried inside us, we can bring it out into the open. We\u0027ll no longer be frightened, and our recovery will flourish in the full light of self-awareness.",
