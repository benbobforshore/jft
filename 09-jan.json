    "body":  "Our sponsor can be an abundant source of recovery information, wisdom, and loving words. They\u0027ve done so much for us. From the late night telephone calls to the hours spent listening to our recovery writing, they\u0027ve believed in us and invested their time to prove it. They\u0027ve lovingly and firmly shown us how to be honest. Their boundless compassion in times of turmoil has given us the strength to go on. Their way of helping has prompted us to seek our answers within ourselves, and we\u0027ve become mature, responsible, confident individuals as a result. Though our sponsor has given so generously and has never demanded repayment, there are things we can do to show our appreciation. We treat our sponsor with respect. They are not a trash can designed for us to dump our garbage in. They have their times of trial, just as we do, and sometimes need our support. They are human, have feelings, and appreciate our concern. Maybe they would like to receive a card in the mail or a phone call expressing our love. Whatever we do to return our sponsor\u0027s kindness will enhance our personal recovery, not to mention the joy we\u0027ll bring to our sponsor.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: My sponsor has cared for me when I couldn\u0027t care for myself. Today, I will do something nice for my sponsor.",
