    "body":  "Some of us, well accustomed to leaving our personal responsibilities to others, may attempt the same behavior in recovery. We quickly find out it doesn\u0027t work. For instance, we are considering making a change in our lives, so we call our sponsor and ask what we should do. Under the guise of seeking direction, we are actually asking our sponsor to assume responsibility for making decisions about our life. Or maybe we\u0027ve been short with someone at a meeting, so we ask that person\u0027s best friend to make our apologies for us. Perhaps we\u0027ve imposed on a friend several times in the last month to cover our service commitment. Could it be that we\u0027ve asked a friend to analyze our behavior and identify our shortcomings, rather than taking our own personal inventory? Recovery is something that has to be worked for. It isn\u0027t going to be handed to us on a silver platter, nor can we expect our friends or our sponsor to be responsible for the work we must do ourselves. We recover by making our own decisions, doing our own service, and working our own steps. By doing it for ourselves, we receive the rewards.",
