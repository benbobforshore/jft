    "body":  "Learning in recovery is hard work. The things we most need to know are often the hardest to learn. We study recovery to prepare ourselves for the experiences life will give us. As we listen to others share in meetings, we take mental notes we can refer to later. To be prepared, we study our notes and literature between \"lessons.\" Just as students have the opportunity to apply their knowledge during tests, so do we have the opportunity to apply our recovery during times of crisis. As always, we have a choice in how we will approach life\u0027s challenges. We can dread and avoid them as threats to our serenity, or we can gratefully accept them as opportunities for growth. By confirming the principles we\u0027ve learned in recovery, life\u0027s challenges give us increased strength. Without such challenges, however, we could forget what we\u0027ve learned and begin to stagnate. These are the opportunities that prod us to new spiritual awakenings. We will find that there is often a period of rest after each crisis, giving us time to get accustomed to our new skills. Once we\u0027ve reflected on our experience, we are called on to share our knowledge with someone who is studying what we\u0027ve just learned. In the school of recovery, all of us are teachers as well as students.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will be a student of recovery. I will welcome challenges, confident in what I\u0027ve learned and eager to share it with others.",
