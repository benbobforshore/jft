    "body":  "Surrender is just for newcomers, right? Wrong! After we\u0027ve been around awhile, some of us succumb to a condition particular to oldtimers. We think we know something about recovery, about God, about NA, about ourselves--and we do. The problem is, we think we know enough, and we think that merely knowing is enough. But it\u0027s what we learn and what we do after we think we know it all that really makes the difference. Conceit and complacency can land us in deep trouble. When we find that \"applying the principles\" on our own power just isn\u0027t working, we can practice what worked for us in the beginning: surrender. When we find we are still powerless, our lives again unmanageable, we need to seek the care of a Power greater than ourselves. And when we discover that self-therapy isn\u0027t so therapeutic after all, we need to take advantage of \"the therapeutic value of one addict helping another.\"",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I need guidance, support, and a Power beyond my own. I will go to a meeting, reach out to a newcomer, call my sponsor, pray to my Higher Power--I will do something that says, \"I surrender.\"",
