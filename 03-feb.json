    "body":  "Addiction closed our minds to anything new or different. We didn\u0027t need anyone or anything, we thought. There was nothing of value to be found in anyone from a different neighborhood, a different racial or ethnic background, or a different social or economic class. We may have thought that if it was different, it was bad. In recovery, we can\u0027t afford such attitudes. We came to NA because our very best thinking had gotten us nowhere. We must open our minds to experience that works, no matter where it comes from, if we hope to grow in our recovery. Regardless of our personal backgrounds, we all have two things in common with one another in NA that we share with no one else: our disease, and our recovery. We depend on one another for our shared experience--and the broader that experience, the better. We need every bit of experience, every different angle on our program we can find to meet the many challenges of living clean. Recovery often isn\u0027t easy. The strength we need to recover, we draw from our fellow NA members. Today, we are grateful for the diversity of our group\u0027s membership, for in that diversity we find our strength.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I know that the more diverse my group\u0027s experience is, the better able my group will be to offer me support in the different circumstances I find myself facing. Today, I welcome addicts from all backgrounds to my home group.",
