Most of us come to NA hanging our heads in shame, thinking about the past and wishing we could go back and change it. Our fantasies and expectations about the future may be so extreme that, on our first date with someone, we find ourselves wondering which lawyer we\u0027ll use for the divorce. Almost every experience causes us to remember something from the past or begin projecting into the future. At first, it\u0027s difficult to stay in the moment. It seems as though our minds won\u0027t stop. We have a hard time just enjoying ourselves. Each time we realize that our thoughts are not focused on what\u0027s happening right now, we can pray and ask a loving God to help us get out of ourselves. If we regret the past, we make amends by living differently today; if we dread the future, we work on living responsibly today. When we work the steps and pray each time we discover we\u0027re not living in the present, we\u0027ll notice that those times aren\u0027t occurring as often as they used to. Our faith will help us live just for today. We\u0027ll have hours, even days, when our full attention is focused on the current moment in time, not the regrettable past or fearful future.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: When I live fully in each moment, I open myself to joys that might otherwise escape me. If I am having trouble, I will ask a loving God for help.",
