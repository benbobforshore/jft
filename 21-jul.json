    "body":  "The First Step begins with \"we,\" and there\u0027s a reason for that. There is great strength in making a verbal admission of our powerlessness. And when we go to meetings and make this admission, we gain more than personal strength. We become members, part of a collective \"we\" that allows us, together, to recover from our addiction. With membership in NA comes a wealth of experience: the experience of other addicts who have found a way to recover from their disease. No longer must we try to solve the puzzle of our addiction on our own. When we honestly admit our powerlessness over our addiction, we can begin the search for a better way to live. We won\u0027t be searching alone--we\u0027re in good company.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will start the day with an admission of my powerlessness over my addiction. I will remind myself that the First Step starts with \"we,\" and know that I never have to be alone with my disease again.",
