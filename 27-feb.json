    "body":  "Imagine a daily meditation book with this kind of message: \"When you wake up in the morning, before you rise from your bed, take a moment for reflection. Lie back, gather your thoughts, and consider your plans for the day. One by one, review the motives behind those plans. If your motives are not entirely pure, roll over and go back to sleep.\" Nonsense, isn\u0027t it? No matter how long we\u0027ve been clean, almost all of us have mixed motives behind almost everything we do. However, that\u0027s no reason to put our lives on hold. We don\u0027t have to wait for our motives to become perfectly pure before we can start living our recovery. As the program works its way into our lives, we begin acting less frequently on our more questionable motives. We regularly examine ourselves, and we talk with our sponsor about what we find. We pray for knowledge of our Higher Power\u0027s will for us, and we seek the power to act on the knowledge we\u0027re given. The result? We don\u0027t get perfect, but we do get better. We\u0027ve begun working a spiritual program. We won\u0027t ever become spiritual giants. But if we look at ourselves realistically, we\u0027ll probably realize that we\u0027ve been doing better than we\u0027ve been feeling.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will examine myself realistically. I will seek the power to act on my best motives, and not to act on my worst.",
