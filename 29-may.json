    "body":  "As using addicts, the demands of our disease determined our personality. We could be whoever or whatever we needed to be in order to get our \"fix.\" We were survival machines, adapting easily to every circumstance of the using life. Once we began our recovery, we entered a new and different life. Many of us had no idea what behavior was appropriate for us in any given situation. Some of us didn\u0027t know how to talk to people, how to dress, or how to behave in public. We couldn\u0027t be ourselves because we didn\u0027t know who we were anymore. The Twelve Steps give us a simple method for finding out who we really are. We uncover our assets and our defects, the things we like about ourselves and the things we\u0027re not so thrilled about. Through the healing power of the Twelve Steps, we begin to understand that we are individuals, created to be who we are by the Higher Power of our understanding. The real healing begins when we understand that if our Higher Power created us this way, it must be okay to be who we really are.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: By working the steps I can experience the freedom to be myself, the person my Higher Power intended me to be.",
