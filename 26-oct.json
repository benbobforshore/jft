    "body":  "\"Principles before personalities.\" Many of us chant these words along with the reader whenever the Twelve Traditions are read. The fact that these words have become a cliche of sorts doesn\u0027t make them any less important, either in service or in our lives. These words are an affirmation: \"We listen to our conscience and do what\u0027s right, no matter who\u0027s involved.\" And that principle serves as one of the cornerstones of recovery as well as our traditions. What does \"principles before personalities\" really mean? It means we practice honesty, humility, compassion, tolerance, and patience with everyone, whether we like them or not. Putting principles before personalities teaches us to treat everyone equally. The Twelfth Step asks us to apply principles in all our affairs; the Twelfth Tradition suggests we apply them to our relations with everyone. Practicing principles doesn\u0027t stop with our friends or when we leave a meeting. It\u0027s for every day, for everyone... in all areas of our lives.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will listen to my conscience and do what\u0027s right. My focus will be on principles, not on people\u0027s personalities.",
