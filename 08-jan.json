    "body":  "When our members celebrate their recovery anniversaries, they often say that they\u0027ve \"grown up\" in NA. Well, then, we think, what does that mean? We start to wonder if we\u0027re grownups yet. We check our lives and yes, all the trappings of adulthood are there: the checkbook, the children, the job, the responsibilities. On the inside, though, we often feel like children. We\u0027re still confused by life much of the time. We don\u0027t always know how to act. We sometimes wonder whether we\u0027re really grown-ups at all, or whether we\u0027re children who\u0027ve somehow been put into adult bodies and given adult responsibilities. Growth is not best measured by physical age or levels of responsibility. Our best measure of growth is our spiritual condition, the basis of our recovery. If we\u0027re still depending on people, places, and things to provide our inner satisfaction, like a child depending on its parents for everything, we do indeed have some growing to do. But if we stand secure on the foundation of our spiritual condition, considering its maintenance our most important responsibility, we can claim maturity. Upon that foundation, our opportunities for growth are limitless.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: The measure of my maturity is the extent to which I take responsibility for the maintenance of my spiritual condition. Today, this will be my highest priority.",
