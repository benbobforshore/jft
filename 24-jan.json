    "body":  "It hurts like never before. You get out of bed after a sleepless night, talk to God, and still don\u0027t feel any better. \"It will pass,\" a little voice tells you. \"When?\" you wonder, as you pace and mutter and get on with your day. You sob in your car and turn the radio all the way up so you can\u0027t hear your own thoughts. But you go straight to work, and don\u0027t even think about using drugs. Your insides feel as though they\u0027ve been torched. Just when the pain becomes unbearable, you go numb and silent. You go to a meeting and wish you were as happy as other members seem to be. But you don\u0027t relapse. You cry some more and call your sponsor. You drive to a friend\u0027s house and don\u0027t even notice the beautiful scenery because your inner landscape is so bleak. You may not feel any better after visiting your friend--but at least you didn\u0027t visit the connection instead. You listen to a Fifth Step. You share at a meeting. You look at the calendar and realize you\u0027ve gotten through another day clean. Then one day you wake up, look outside, and realize it\u0027s a beautiful day. The sun is shining. The sky is blue. You take a deep breath, smile again, and know that it really does pass.",
