    "body":  "Many of us came to Narcotics Anonymous with something less than an overwhelming desire to stop using. Sure, the drugs were causing us problems, and we wanted to be rid of the problems, but we didn\u0027t want to stop getting high. Eventually, though, we saw that we couldn\u0027t have one without the other. Even though we really wanted to get loaded, we didn\u0027t use; we weren\u0027t willing to pay the price anymore. The longer we stayed clean and worked the program, the more freedom we experienced. Sooner or later, the compulsion to use was lifted from us completely, and we stayed clean because we wanted to live clean. The same principles apply to other negative impulses that may plague us. We may feel like doing something destructive, just because we want to. We\u0027ve done it before, and sometimes we think we\u0027ve gotten away with it, but sometimes we haven\u0027t. If we\u0027re not willing to pay the price for acting on such feelings, we don\u0027t have to act on them. It may be hard, maybe even as hard as it was to stay clean in the beginning. But others have felt the same way and have found the freedom not to act on their negative impulses. By sharing about it and seeking the help of other recovering people and a Power greater than ourselves, we can find the direction, the support, and the strength we need to abstain from any destructive compulsion.",
