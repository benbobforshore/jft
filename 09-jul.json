    "body":  "Most of us come to Narcotics Anonymous with a variety of preconceptions about what the word \"God\" means, many of them negative. Yet the \"G\" word is used very regularly in NA, if not constantly.  It occurs 92 times in the first 102 pages of our Basic Text, and appears prominently in a third of our Twelve Steps. Rather than sidestep the sensitivity many of us feel toward the word, let\u0027s address it head on.It\u0027s true that Narcotics Anonymous is a spiritual program. Our Twelve Steps offer a way to find freedom from addiction through the help of a spiritual Power greater than we are. The program, however, doesn\u0027t tell us anything about what we have to think about that Power.  In fact, over and over again, in our literature and our meetings, we hear it said, \"the God of our understanding\"--whatever that understanding may be.We use the word \"God\" because it\u0027s used in our Basic Text and because it communicates most effectively to most people a basic understanding of the Power underlying our recovery. The word, we use for the sake of convenience. The Power behind the word, however, we use for more than convenience. We use that Power to maintain our freedom from addiction and to ensure our ongoing recovery.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: Whether I believe in \"God\" or not, I will use the Power that keeps me clean and free.",
