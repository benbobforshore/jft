    "body":  "A challenge is anything that dares us to succeed. Things new and unfamiliar serve as challenges, whether those things appear good or bad to us. We are challenged by obstacles and opposition from within ourselves and from without. New and difficult things, obstacles and opposition, all are a part of \"life on life\u0027s terms.\" Living clean means learning to meet challenges. Many of us, consciously or unconsciously, took drugs to avoid meeting challenge. Many of us were equally afraid of failure and success. Each time we declined the day\u0027s challenge, we suffered a loss of self-esteem. Some of us used drugs to mask the shame we felt. Each time we did that, we became even less able to meet our challenges and more likely to use. By working the NA program, we\u0027ve found the tools we need to successfully meet any challenge. We\u0027ve come to believe in a Power greater than ourselves, a Power that cares for our will and our lives. We\u0027ve asked that Power to remove our character defects, those things that made our lives unmanageable. We\u0027ve taken action to improve our conscious contact with that Higher Power. Through the steps, we\u0027ve been given the ability to stop using drugs and start living. Each day, we are faced with new challenges. And each day, through working our program of recovery, we are given the grace to meet those challenges.",
