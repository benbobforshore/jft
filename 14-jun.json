    "body":  "Most of us--if we\u0027ve been in recovery for any length of time at all--have heard some member complaining in a meeting about being terribly overworked, too busy for meetings or sponsorship or other activities. In fact, we may have been the complaining member. The days seem so full: job, family and friends, meetings, activities, sponsorship, step work. \"There just aren\u0027t enough hours in the day,\" the member complains, \"to get everything done and meet everyone\u0027s demands on my time!\"When this happens, usually there\u0027s soft laughter from some of the other members--probably members who had planned to grumble about the same sort of thing. The laughter stems from our recognition that we are complaining about the miracle of the life that is ours today. Not so long ago, few of us were capable of having any of these \"problems\" in our life. We devoted all of our energy to maintaining our active addiction. Today we have full lives, complete with all the feelings and problems that go with living in reality.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will remember that my life is a miracle. Instead of resenting how busy I am, I will be thankful my life is so full.",
