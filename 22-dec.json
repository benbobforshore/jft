    "body":  "What was the worst aspect of active addiction? For many of us, it wasn\u0027t the chance that we might die some day of our disease. The worst part was the living death we experienced every day, the never-ending meaninglessness of life. We felt like walking ghosts, not living, loving parts of the world around us.In recovery, we\u0027ve come to believe that we\u0027re here for a reason: to love ourselves and to love others. In working the Twelve Steps, we have learned to accept ourselves. With that self-acceptance has come self-respect. We have seen that everything we do has an effect on others; we are a part of the lives of those around us, and they of ours. We\u0027ve begun to trust other people and to acknowledge our responsibility to them.In recovery we\u0027ve come back to life.  We maintain our new lives by contributing to the welfare of others and seeking each day to do that better--that\u0027s where the Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Steps come in.  The days of living like a ghost are past, but only so long as we actively seek to be healthy, loving, contributing parts of our own lives and the lives of others around us.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I have found a new way to live. Today, I will seek to serve others with love and to love myself.",
