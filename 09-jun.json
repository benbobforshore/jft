    "body":  "From time to time we wonder if we\u0027re \"doing it right\" in Narcotics Anonymous. Are we attending enough meetings? Are we using our sponsor, or working the steps, or speaking, or reading, or living the \"right\" way? We value the fellowship of recovering addicts--we don\u0027t know what we\u0027d do without it. What if the way we\u0027re practicing our program is \"wrong\"? Does that make us \"bad\" NA members?We can settle our insecurities by reviewing our Third tradition, which assures us that \"the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using.\" There aren\u0027t any rules that say we\u0027ve got to attend this many meetings or these particular meetings, or work the \"steps\" this way at this pace, or live our lives to suit these people in order to remain NA members in good standing.It\u0027s true that, if we want the kind of recovery we see in members we respect, we\u0027ll want to practice the kind of program that\u0027s made their recovery possible. But NA is a fellowship of freedom; we work the program the best way for us, not for someone else. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will look at the program I\u0027m working in light of my own recovery. I will practice that program to the best of my ability.",
