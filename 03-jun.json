    "body":  "Something\u0027s not working. In fact, something\u0027s been wrong for a long time, causing us pain and complicating our lives. The problem is that, at any given moment, it always appears easier to continue bearing the pain of our defects than to submit to the total upheaval involved in changing the way we live. We may long to be free of pain, but only rarely are we willing to do what\u0027s truly necessary to remove the source of pain from our lives.Most of didn\u0027t begin seeking recovery from addiction until we were \"sick and tired of being tired and sick.\" The same is true of the lingering character defects we\u0027ve carried through our lives. Only when we can\u0027t bear our shortcomings one moment longer, only when we know that the pain of change can\u0027t be as bad as the pain we\u0027re in today, are most of us willing to try something different.Thankfully, the steps are always there, no matter what we\u0027re sick and tired of. The irony is that, as soon as we make the decision to begin the Twelve Step process, we realize our fears of change were groundless. The steps offer a gentle program of change, one step at a time. No single step is so frightening that we can\u0027t work it, by itself. As we apply the steps to our lives, we experience a change that frees us.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: No matter what prevents me from living a full, happy life, I know the program can help me change, a step at a time. I need not be afraid of the Twelve Steps.",
