    "body":  "As we work the steps, we\u0027re bound to discover some basic truths about ourselves. The process of uncovering our secrets, exposing them, and searching our characters reveals our true nature. As we become acquainted with ourselves, we\u0027ll need to make a decision to be just who we are. We may want to take a look at what we present to our fellow addicts and the world and see if it matches up with what we\u0027ve discovered inside. Do we pretend that nothing bothers us when, in truth, we\u0027re very sensitive? Do we cover our insecurities with obnoxious jokes, or do we share our fears with someone? Do we dress like a teenager when we\u0027re approaching forty and are basically conservative? We may want to take another look at those things which we thought \"weren\u0027t us.\" Maybe we\u0027ve avoided NA activities because we \"don\u0027t like crowds.\" Or maybe we have a secret dream of changing careers but have put off taking action because our dream \"wasn\u0027t really right\" for us. As we attain a new understanding of ourselves, we\u0027ll want to adjust our behavior accordingly. We want to be genuine examples of who we are.",
