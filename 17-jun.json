    "body":  "It\u0027s relatively easy to accept the things we like--it\u0027s the things we don\u0027t like that are hard to accept. But remaking the world and everyone in it to suit our tastes would solve nothing. After all, the idea that the world was to blame for all our problems was the attitude that kept us using--and that attitude nearly killed us.In the course of working the steps, we begin to ask ourselves hard questions about the roles we ourselves have played in creating the unacceptable lives we\u0027ve lived. In most cases, we\u0027ve found that what needed changing was our own attitude and our own actions, not the people, places, and things around us.In recovery, we pray for wisdom to know the difference between what can and can\u0027t be changed. Then, once we see the truth of our situation, we pray for the willingness to change ourselves.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: Higher Power, grant me the wisdom to know the difference between what can be changed and what I must accept. Please help me gratefully accept the life I\u0027ve been given.",
