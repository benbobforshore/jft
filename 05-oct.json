    "body":  "Many of us have been \"thirty-day wonders.\" We were desperate and dying when we showed up at our first NA meeting. We identified with the addicts we met there and the message they shared. With their support, we were finally able to stop using and catch a free breath. For the first time in a long, long time, we felt at home. Overnight, our lives were transformed; we walked, talked, ate, drank, slept, and dreamed Narcotics Anonymous. Then, Narcotics Anonymous lost its novelty. Meetings that had been a thrill became monotonous. Our wonderful NA friends became bores; their uplifting NA talk, drivel. When our former friends called, inviting us back for some of the old fun, we kissed our recovery goodbye. Sooner or later, we made our way back to the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous. Nothing had changed out there, we\u0027d discovered--not us, not our friends, not the drugs, not anything. If anything, it had gotten worse than ever. True, NA meetings may not be a laugh riot, and our NA friends may not be spiritual giants. But there\u0027s a power in the meetings, a common bond among the members, a life to the program that we can\u0027t do without. Today, our recovery is more than just a fad--it\u0027s a way of life. We\u0027re going to practice living our program like our lives depend on it, because they do.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I\u0027m no \"thirty-day wonder.\" The NA way is my way of life, and I\u0027m here for the duration.",
