    "body":  "All of us have ideas, plans, goals for our lives. There\u0027s nothing in the NA program that says we shouldn\u0027t think for ourselves, take initiative, and put responsible plans into action. It\u0027s when our lives are driven by self-will that we run into problems. When we are living willfully, we go beyond thinking for ourselves--we think only of ourselves. We forget that we are but a part of the world and that whatever personal strength we have is drawn from a Higher Power. We might even go so far as to imagine that other people exist solely to do our bidding. Quickly, we find ourselves at odds with everyone and everything around us. At this point, we have two choices. We can continue in our slavery to self-will, making unreasonable demands and becoming frustrated because the planet doesn\u0027t spin our way. Or we can surrender, relax, seek knowledge of God\u0027s will and the power to carry that out, and find our way back to a condition of peace with the world. Thinking, taking initiative, making responsible plans--there\u0027s nothing wrong with these things, so long as they serve God\u0027s will, not merely our own.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will plan to do God\u0027s will, not mine. If I find myself at odds with everything around me, I will surrender self-will.",
