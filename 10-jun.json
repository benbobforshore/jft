    "body":  "Most of us had dreams when we were young. Whether we dreamed of a dynamic career, a large and loving family, or travels abroad, our dreams died when our addiction took hold. Anything we ever wanted for ourselves was cast away in our pursuit of drugs. Our dreams didn\u0027t go beyond the next drug and the euphoria we hoped it would bring.Now in recovery, we find a reason to hope that our lost dreams could still come true. No matter how old we are, how much our addiction has taken from us, or how unlikely it may seem, our freedom from active addiction gives us the freedom to pursue our ambitions. We may discover that we\u0027re very talented at something, or find a hobby we love, or learn that continuing our education can bring remarkable rewards.We used to put most of our energy into spinning excuses and rationalizations for our failures. Today, we go forward and make use of the many opportunities life presents to us. We may be amazed at what we\u0027re capable of. With our foundation of recovery, success, fulfillment, and satisfaction are within our reach at last.",
