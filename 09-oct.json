    "body":  "Addiction gave a pattern to our lives, and with it a meaning--a dark, diseased meaning, to be sure, but a meaning nonetheless. The Narcotics Anonymous recovery program gives us a new pattern of living to replace our old routines. And with that new pattern comes a new meaning to our lives, one of light and hope. What is this new pattern of living? Instead of isolation, we find fellowship. Instead of living blindly, repeating the same mistakes again and again, we regularly examine ourselves, free to keep what helps us grow and discard what doesn\u0027t. Rather than constantly trying to get by on our own limited power, we develop a conscious contact with a loving Power greater than ourselves. Our life must have a pattern. To maintain our recovery, we must maintain the new patterns our program has taught us. By giving regular attention to these patterns, we will maintain the freedom we\u0027ve found from the deadly disease of addiction, and keep hold of the meaning recovery has brought to our lives.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will begin a new pattern in my life: the regular maintenance of my recovery.",
