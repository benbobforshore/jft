    "body":  "Ever have a day when everything seems to be working against you? Do you go through periods when you are so busy taking people\u0027s inventories you can barely stand yourself? What about when you find yourself snapping at your co-worker or loved one for no reason? When we find ourselves in this bleak frame of mind, we need to take action. At any point in the day, we can set aside a few moments and take a \"spot inventory.\" We examine how we are reacting to outside situations and other people. When we do, we may find that we are suffering from a plain old \"bad attitude.\" A negative outlook can hurt our relationship with our Higher Power and the people in our lives. When we are honest with ourselves, we frequently find that the problem lies with us and our attitude. We have no control over the challenges life gives us. What we can control is how we react to those challenges. At any point in time, we can change our attitude. The only thing that really changes in Narcotics Anonymous is us. The Twelve Steps give us the tools to move out of the problem and into the solution.",
