    "body":  "In many ways, addicts are different. When we came to Narcotics Anonymous we found others like ourselves, people who understood us and whom we could understand. No longer did we feel like aliens, strangers wherever we went. We were at home in NA meetings, among friends. We don\u0027t stop being addicts after we\u0027ve been clean awhile. We still need to identify with other addicts. We continue coming to NA meetings to keep in touch with who we are, where we\u0027ve come from, and where we\u0027re going. Every meeting reminds us that we can never use drugs successfully. Every meeting reminds us that we\u0027ll never be cured, but that by practicing the principles of the program we can recover. And every meeting offers us the experience and example of other addicts in ongoing recovery. At meetings, we see how different people work their program, and the results are apparent in their lives. If we want the lives we see others living, we can find out what they\u0027ve done to get where they are. Narcotics Anonymous meetings offer us identification with where we\u0027ve been and where we can go--identification we can\u0027t do without and can\u0027t get anywhere else. That keeps us coming back.",
