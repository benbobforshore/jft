    "body":  "\"Just for today\"--it\u0027s a comforting thought. If we try to live in the past, we may find ourselves torn by painful, disquieting memories. The lessons of our using are not the teachers we seek for recovery. Living in tomorrow means moving in with fear.  We cannot see the shape of the secret future, and uncertainty brings worry. Our lives look overwhelming when we lose the focus of today. Living in the moment offers freedom. In this moment, we know that we are safe. We are not using, and we have everything we need. What\u0027s more, life is happening in the here and now. The past is gone and the future has yet to arrive; our worrying won\u0027t change any of it. Today, we can enjoy our recovery, this very minute.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will stay in the here and now. Today-- this moment--I am free.",
