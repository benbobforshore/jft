    "body":  "Many of us have heard truly captivating speakers at Narcotics Anonymous conventions. We remember the audience alternating between tears of identification and joyous hilarity. \"Someday,\" we may think, \"I\u0027m going to be a main speaker at a convention, too.\" Well, for many of us, that day has yet to arrive. Once in awhile we may be asked to speak at a meeting near where we live. We might speak at a small convention workshop. But after all this time, we\u0027re still not \"hot\" convention speakers--and that\u0027s okay. We\u0027ve learned that we, too, have a special message to share, even if it\u0027s only at a local meeting with fifteen or twenty addicts in attendance. Each of us has only our own story to tell; that\u0027s it. We can\u0027t tell anyone else\u0027s story. Every time we get up to speak, many of us find all the clever lines and funny stories seem to disappear from our minds. But we do have something to offer. We carry the message of hope--we can and do recover from our addiction. And that\u0027s enough.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will remember that my honest story is what I share the best. Today, that\u0027s enough.",
