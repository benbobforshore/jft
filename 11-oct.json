    "body":  "Ever been tempted to do something even when you knew the results would be disastrous? Ever thought about how much it was going to hurt to do what you were tempted to do, then proceed to do it anyway? It is said that there are consequences to every action. Before we got clean, many of us simply didn\u0027t believe this. But now we know exactly what it means. When we act, we know there will be consequences to pay. No longer can we decide to do something in ignorance when we know full well that we won\u0027t like the price we\u0027ll have to pay. There\u0027s a prize and a price. It\u0027s okay to act despite the consequences if we\u0027re willing to pay the price, but there\u0027s always one to pay.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will think about the consequences of my actions before I take them.",
