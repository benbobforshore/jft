    "body":  "\"Poor me; woe is me; look at me, my life is such a mess! I\u0027ve fallen, and no matter how hard I try, I continue to fail.\" Many of us came to NA singing this sad refrain. Life isn\u0027t like that anymore. True, sometimes we still stumble; at times we even fall. Sometimes we feel like we can\u0027t move forward in our lives, no matter how hard we try. But the truth of the matter is that, with the help of other recovering addicts in NA, we find a hand to pull us up, dust us off, and help us start all over again. That\u0027s the new refrain in our lives today.No longer do we say, \"I\u0027m a failure and I\u0027m going nowhere.\" Usually, it\u0027s more like, \"Rats! I hit that same bump in the road of life again. Pretty soon I\u0027ll learn to slow down or avoid it entirely.\" Until then, we may continue to fall down occasionally, but we\u0027ve learned that there\u0027s always a helping hand to set us on our feet again.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: If I begin to cry failure, I\u0027ll remember there is a way to move forward. I will accept the encouragement and support of NA.",
