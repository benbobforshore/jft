    "body":  "Mistakes! We all know how it feels to make them. Many of us feel that our entire lives have been a mistake. We often regard our mistakes with shame or guilt--at the very least, with frustration and impatience. We tend to see mistakes as evidence that we are still sick, crazy, stupid, or too damaged to recover. In truth, mistakes are a very vital and important part of being human. For particularly stubborn people (such as addicts), mistakes are often our best teachers. There is no shame in making mistakes. In fact, making new mistakes often shows our willingness to take risks and grow. It\u0027s helpful, though, if we learn from our mistakes; repeating the same ones may be a sign that we\u0027re stuck. And expecting different results from the same old mistakes--well, that\u0027s what we call \"insanity.\" It just doesn\u0027t work.",
