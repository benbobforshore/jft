    "body":  "In active addiction, many of us used self-pity as a survival mechanism. We didn\u0027t believe there was an alternative to living in our disease-or perhaps we didn\u0027t want to believe. As long as we could feel sorry for ourselves and blame someone else for our troubles, we didn\u0027t have to accept the consequences of our actions; believing ourselves powerless to change, we didn\u0027t have to accept the need for change. Using this \"survival mechanism\" kept us from entering recovery and led us closer, day by day, to self-destruction. Self-pity is a tool of our disease; we need to stop using it and learn instead to use the new tools we find in the NA program. We have come to believe that effective help is available for us; when we seek that help, finding it in the NA program, self-pity is displaced by gratitude. Many tools are at our disposal: the Twelve Steps, the support of our sponsor, the fellowship of other recovering addicts, and the care of our Higher Power. The availability of all these tools is more than enough reason to be grateful. We no longer live in isolation, without hope; we have certain help at hand for anything we may face. The surest way to become grateful is to take advantage of the help available to us in the NA program and to experience the improvement the program will bring in our lives.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will be grateful for the hope NA has given me. I will cultivate my recovery and stop cultivating self-pity.",
