    "body":  "We\u0027ve heard it said that \"we\u0027re as sick as our secrets.\" What do we keep secret, and why?We keep secret those things that cause us shame. We may hold onto such things because we don\u0027t want to surrender them. Yet if they\u0027re causing us shame, wouldn\u0027t we live more easily with ourselves if we were rid of them?Some of us hold onto the things that cause us shame for another reason. It\u0027s not that we don\u0027t want to be rid of them; we just don\u0027t believe we can be rid of them. They\u0027ve plagued us for so long, and we\u0027ve tried so many times to rid ourselves of them, that we\u0027ve stopped hoping for relief. Yet still they shame us, and still we keep them secret.We need to remember who we are: recovering addicts. We who tried so long to keep our drug use a secret have found freedom from the obsession and compulsion to use. Though many of us enjoyed using right to the end, we sought recovery anyway. We just couldn\u0027t stand the toll our using was taking on us. When we admitted our powerlessness and sought help from others, the burden of our secret was lifted from us.The same principle applies to whatever secrets may burden us. Yes, we\u0027re as sick as our secrets. Only when our secrets stop being secret can we begin to find relief from those things that cause us shame.",
