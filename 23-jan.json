    "body":  "Ever had a perfect stranger remark about how great the weather was, only to reply \"It stinks\"? When this happens, we are probably suffering from a lack of daily maintenance in our program. In recovery, life can get pretty hectic. Maybe those added responsibilities at work have got you hopping. Maybe you haven\u0027t been to a meeting for awhile. Perhaps you\u0027ve been too busy to meditate, or haven\u0027t been eating regularly or sleeping well. Whatever the reason, your serenity is slipping. When this happens, it is crucial that we take action. We can\u0027t afford to let one \"bad day\" complete with a bad attitude, slip into two days, four days, or a week. Our recovery depends on our daily maintenance program. No matter what is happening in our lives, we can\u0027t afford to neglect the principles that have saved our lives. There are many ways to recover our serenity. We can go to a meeting, phone our sponsor, meet another recovering addict for lunch, or try to carry the message to a newcomer. We can pray. We can take a moment to ask ourselves what simple things we haven\u0027t been doing. When our attitudes head downhill, we can avert a crash with simple solutions.",
