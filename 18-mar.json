    "body":  "Before coming to NA, many of us thought we were brave simply because we had never experienced fear. We had drugged all our feelings, fear among them, until we had convinced ourselves that we were tough, courageous people who wouldn\u0027t crack under any circumstances. But finding our courage in drugs has nothing to do with the way we live our lives today. Clean and in recovery, we are bound to feel frightened at times. When we first realize we are feeling frightened, we may think we are cowards. Were afraid to pick up the phone because the person on the other end might not understand. We\u0027re afraid to ask someone to sponsor us because they might say no. We\u0027re afraid to look for a job. We\u0027re afraid to be honest with our friends. But all of these fears are natural, even healthy. What\u0027s not healthy is allowing fear to paralyze us. When we permit our fear to stop our growth, we will be defeated. True courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the willingness to walk through it.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will be courageous today. When I\u0027m afraid, I\u0027ll do what I need to do to grow in recovery.",
