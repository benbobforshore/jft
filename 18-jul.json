    "body":  "The room is dark. Your forehead is bathed in cold sweat. Your heart is racing. You open your eyes, sure that you\u0027ve just blown your clean time. You\u0027ve had a \"using dream,\" and it was just like being there--the people, the places, the routine, the sick feeling in your stomach, everything. It takes a few moments to realize it was just a nightmare, that it didn\u0027t actually happen. Slowly, you settle down and return to sleep. \r\nThe next morning is the time to examine what really happened the night before. You didn\u0027t use last night--but how close are you to using today? Do you have any illusions about your ability to control your using? Do you know, without a doubt, what would happen once you took the first drug? What stands between you and a real, live relapse? How strong is your program? Your relationships with your sponsor, your home group, and your Higher Power? Using dreams don\u0027t necessarily indicate a hole in our program; for a drug addict, there\u0027s nothing more natural than to dream of using drugs. Some of us think of using dreams as gifts from our Higher Power, vividly reminding us of the insanity of active addiction and encouraging us to strengthen our recovery. Seen in that light, we can be grateful for using dreams. Frightening as they are, they can prove to be great blessings--if we use them to reinforce our recovery.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will examine my personal program. I will talk with my sponsor about what I find, and seek ways to strengthen my recovery.",
