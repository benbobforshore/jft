    "body":  "The Fifth Step asks us to share our true nature with God, with ourselves, and with another human being. It doesn\u0027t encourage us to tell everyone every little secret about ourselves. It doesn\u0027t ask us to disclose to the whole world every shameful or frightening thought we\u0027ve ever had. Step Five simply suggests that our secrets cause us more harm than good when we keep them completely to ourselves. If we give in to our reluctance to reveal our true nature to even one human being, the secret side of our lives becomes more powerful. And when the secrets are in control, they drive a wedge between ourselves, our Higher Power, and the things we value most about our recovery. When we share our secret selves in confidence with at least one human being--our sponsor, perhaps, or a close friend--this person usually doesn\u0027t reject us. We disclose ourselves to someone else and are rewarded with their acceptance. When this happens, we realize that honest sharing is not life-threatening; the secrets have lost their power over us.",
