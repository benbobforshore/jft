    "body":  "When new in recovery, most of us had at least one person we just couldn\u0027t stand. We thought that person was the rudest, most obnoxious person in the program. We knew there was something we could do, some principle of recovery we could practice to get over the way we felt about this person--but what? We asked our sponsor for guidance. We were probably assured, with an amused smile, that if we just kept coming back, we\u0027d see the person get better. That made sense to us. We believed that the steps of NA worked in the lives of everyone. If they could work for us, they could work for this horrible person, too. Time passed, and at some point we noticed that the person didn\u0027t seem as rude or obnoxious as before. In fact, he or she had become downright tolerable, maybe even likeable. We got a pleasant jolt as we realized who had really gotten better. Because we had kept coming back, because we had kept working the steps, our perception of this person had changed. The person who\u0027d plagued us had become \"tolerable\" because we\u0027d developed some tolerance; he or she had become \"likeable\" because we\u0027d developed the ability to love. So who really gets better? We do! As we practice the program, we gain a whole new outlook on those around us by gaining a new outlook on ourselves.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: As I get better, so will others. Today, I will practice tolerance and try to love those I meet.",
