    "body":  "It\u0027s been said that recovery is simple--all we\u0027ve got to change is everything! That can seem a pretty tall order, especially when we first arrive in Narcotics Anonymous. After all, not many of us showed up at our first meeting because our lives were in great shape. On the contrary, a great many of us came to NA in the midst of the worst crises of our lives. We needed recovery, and quick! The enormity of the change required in our lives can be paralyzing. We know we can\u0027t take care of all that needs to be done, not all at once. How do we start? Chances are, we\u0027ve already started. We\u0027ve done the first, most obvious things that needed to be done: We\u0027ve stopped using drugs, and we\u0027ve started going to meetings. What do we do next? Pretty much the same thing, just more of it: From where we are, we do what we can. We walk the path of recovery by picking up our feet and taking the step that\u0027s right in front of us. Only when that\u0027s been accomplished must we concern ourselves with what comes next. Slowly but surely, we\u0027ll find ourselves making progress down the path, visibly drawing closer each day to becoming the kind of person we\u0027d like to be.",
