    "body":  "We\u0027ve heard it said that unless we\u0027re in love, we can\u0027t remember what love feels like. The same could be said of insanity: Once we\u0027re freed of it, we may forget how truly bizarre our insane thinking can be. But to be grateful for the degree of sanity to which we\u0027ve been restored in Narcotics Anonymous, we need to remember just how truly insane we\u0027ve been. Today, it may be hard to imagine saying something as ridiculous as, \"May I please have a heart attack or a fatal accident?\" No one in their right mind is going to ask for such things. And that\u0027s the point. In our active addiction, we were not in our right mind. Each day we practiced our addiction, we courted fatal disease, degradation, exploitation, impoverishment, imprisonment, death by violence, even death by sheer stupidity. In that context, the idea of asking for a heart attack or a fatal accident doesn\u0027t sound all that far out. That\u0027s how insane we\u0027ve been. The program, the fellowship, and our Higher power--together, they\u0027ve worked a miracle. The Second Step is not a vain hope--it is reality. Knowing the degree of the insanity we\u0027ve experienced, we can appreciate all the more the miraculous Power that has restored us thus far to sanity. For that, we are truly grateful.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will take some time to recall how insane I\u0027ve been while practicing my addiction. Then, I will thank my Higher Power for the sanity that\u0027s been restored to my life.",
