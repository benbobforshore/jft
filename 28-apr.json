    "body":  "Many of us had trouble identifying our resentments when we were new in recovery. There we sat with our Fourth Step in front of us, thinking and thinking, finally deciding that we just didn\u0027t have any resentments. Perhaps we talked ourselves into believing that we weren\u0027t so sick after all. Such unwitting denial of our resentments stems from the conditioning of our addiction. Most of our feelings were buried, and buried deep. After some time in recovery, a new sense of understanding develops. Our most deeply buried feelings begin to surface, and those resentments we thought we didn\u0027t have suddenly emerge. As we examine these resentments, we may feel tempted to hold onto some of them, especially if we think they are \"justified.\" But what we need to remember is that \"justified\" resentments are just as burdensome as any other resentment. As our awareness of our liabilities grows, so does our responsibility to let go. We no longer need to hang on to our resentments. We want to rid ourselves of what\u0027s undesirable and set ourselves free to recover.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: When I discover a resentment, I\u0027ll see it for what it is and let it go.",
