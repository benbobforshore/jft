    "body":  "Many of us come to Narcotics Anonymous full of regrets about our past. Our steps help us begin to resolve those regrets. We examine our lives, admit our wrongs, make amends for them, and sincerely try to change our behavior. In doing so, we find a joyous sense of freedom. No longer must we deny or regret our past. Once we\u0027ve made our amends, what\u0027s done is truly over and gone. From that point on, where we come from ceases to be the most important thing about us. It\u0027s where we are going that counts. In NA, we begin to look forward. True, we live and stay clean just for today. But we find that we can begin to set goals, dream dreams, and look ahead to the joys a life in recovery has to offer. Looking forward keeps us centered in where we are going, not remorseful or regretful about our past. After all, it is hard to move forward if we are looking back.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: The steps have freed me from regrets over my past. Today, I look forward to my new life in recovery.",
