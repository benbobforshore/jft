    "body":  "Ever had a panic attack? Everywhere we turn, life\u0027s demands overwhelm us. We\u0027re paralyzed, and we don\u0027t know what to do about it. How do we break an anxiety attack? First, we stop. We can\u0027t deal with everything at once, so we stop for a moment to let things settle. Then we take a \"spot inventory\" of the things that are bothering us. We examine each item, asking ourselves this question: \"How important is it, really?\" In most cases, we\u0027ll find that most of our fears and concerns don\u0027t need our immediate attention. We can put those aside, and focus on the issues that really need to be resolved right away. Then we stop again and ask ourselves, \"Who\u0027s in control here, anyway?\" This helps remind us that our Higher Power is in control. We seek our Higher Power\u0027s will for the situation, whatever it is. We can do this in any number of ways: through prayer, talks with our sponsor or NA friends, or by attending a meeting and asking others to share their experience. When our Higher Power\u0027s will becomes clear to us, we pray for the ability to carry it out. Finally, we take action. Anxiety attacks need not paralyze us. We can utilize the resources of the NA program to deal with anything that comes our way.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: My Higher Power has not brought me all this way in recovery only to abandon me! When anxiety strikes, I will take specific steps to seek God\u0027s continuing care and guidance.",
