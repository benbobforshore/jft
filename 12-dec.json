    "body":  "It\u0027s funny to remember how reluctant we once were to surrender to recovery. We seemed to think we had wonderful, fulfilling lives as using addicts and that giving up our drugs would be worse than serving a life sentence at hard labor. In reality, the opposite was true: Our lives were miserable, but we were afraid to trade that familiar misery for the uncertainties of recovery. It\u0027s possible to be miserable in recovery, too, though it\u0027s not necessary. No one will force us to work the steps, go to meetings, or work with a sponsor. There is no NA militia that will force us to do the things that will free us from pain. But we do have a choice. We\u0027ve already chosen to give up the misery of active addiction for the sanity of recovery. Now, if we\u0027re ready to exchange today\u0027s misery for even greater peace, we have a means to do just that--if we really want to.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I don\u0027t have to be miserable unless I really want to be. Today, I will trade in my misery for the benefits of recovery.",
