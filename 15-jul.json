    "body":  "One of the first things that happens to many of us in recovery is that we start to look better. We get healthier; we bathe; we dress more appropriately. And without the goading of active addiction, many of us finally stop stealing, lying, and hustling. We start to look normal--just by removing the drugs. Looking normal is very different than being normal. Acceptability in the eyes of the world is a benefit of recovery; it is not the same thing as recovery. We can enjoy the benefits of recovery, but we must take care to nurture their true source. Lasting recovery isn\u0027t found in acceptance from others, but in the inner growth set in motion by the Twelve Steps.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I know that looking good isn\u0027t enough. Lasting recovery is an inside job.",
