    "body":  "Our lives are progressing nicely. Things are going good, and each year in recovery brings more material and spiritual gifts. We may have a little money in the bank, a new car, or a committed relationship. We have a little self-confidence, and our faith in a Higher Power is growing. Then, something happens. Someone breaks into our new car and steals the stereo, or the person we\u0027re in the relationship with becomes unfaithful. Right away, we feel victimized. \"Where\u0027s the justice?\" we wail. But if we take a look back on our own behavior, we may find that we\u0027ve been guilty of what\u0027s just been done to us. We realize we wouldn\u0027t really want justice--not for ourselves, and not for others. What we want is mercy.We thank a loving God for the compassion we\u0027ve been shown, and we take the time to appreciate all the precious gifts that recovery brings.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will pray for mercy, not justice. I am grateful for the compassion I\u0027ve been shown, and will offer mercy to others.",
