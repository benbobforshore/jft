    "body":  "You\u0027re in a meeting. The sharing has been going on for some time. One or two members have described their spiritual experiences in an especially meaningful way. Another has had us all rolling in the aisles with entertaining stories. And then the leader calls on you... gulp. You shyly introduce yourself, apologetically stammer out a few lines, thank everyone for listening, and sit out the rest of the meeting in embarrassed silence. Sound familiar? Well, you\u0027re not alone. We\u0027ve all had times when we\u0027ve felt that what we had to share wasn\u0027t spiritual enough, wasn\u0027t entertaining enough, wasn\u0027t something enough. But sharing is not a competitive sport. The meat of our meetings is identification and experience, something all of us have in abundance. When we share from our hearts the truth of our experience, other addicts feel they can trust us because they know we\u0027re just like them. When we simply share what\u0027s been effective in our lives, we can be sure that our message will be helpful to others. Our sharing doesn\u0027t have to be either fancy or funny to ring true. Every addict working an honest program that brings meaningful recovery has something of immense value to share, something no one else can give: his or her own experience.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I have something valuable to share. I will attend a meeting today and share my experience in recovery from addiction.",
