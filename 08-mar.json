    "body":  "Things can get really good in our recovery. Perhaps we\u0027ve found our \"soul mate,\" built a rewarding career, started a family. Maybe our relationships with our family members have healed. Things are going so well, we barely have time to attend meetings. Perhaps we begin to reintegrate into society so successfully that we forget that we don\u0027t always react to situations like others do. Maybe, just maybe, we\u0027ve put some priorities ahead of themselves. Is meeting attendance still a priority with us? Do we still sponsor? Do we phone our sponsor? What step are we working? Are we still willing to drag ourselves out of bed at some ungodly hour for a Twelfth Step call? Do we remember to practice principles in all our affairs? If others in NA reach out to us, are we available? Do we remember where we came from, or have the \"good times\" allowed us to forget? To stay clean, we must remember that we are only one drug away from our past. We stay grateful for the good times, but we don\u0027t let them divert us from our continuing recovery in Narcotics Anonymous.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I\u0027m grateful for the good times, but I\u0027ve not forgotten from where I\u0027ve come. Today, my first priority is staying clean and growing in my recovery.",
