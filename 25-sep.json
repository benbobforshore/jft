    "body":  "In a lifelong process of coming to believe, our understanding of God will change. The understanding we have when new in recovery will not be the same when we have a few months clean, nor will that understanding be the same when we have a few years clean. Our initial understanding of a Power greater than ourselves will most likely be limited. That Power will keep us clean but, we may think, nothing more. We may hesitate to pray because we have placed conditions on what we will ask our Higher Power to do for us. \"Oh, this stuff is so awful, even God couldn\u0027t do anything,\" we might say, or \"God\u0027s got a lot of people to take care of. There\u0027s no time for me.\" But, as we grow in recovery, so will our understanding. We\u0027ll begin to see that the only limits to God\u0027s love and grace are those we impose by refusing to step out of the way. The loving God we come to believe in is infinite, and the power and love we find in our belief is shared by nearly every recovering addict around the world.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: The God I am coming to understand has a limitless capacity for love and care. I will trust that my God is bigger than any problem I may have.",
