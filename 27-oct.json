    "body":  "Our addiction has been a source of shame to many of us. We have hidden ourselves from others, sure that if anyone got to know who we really were they would reject us. NA helps us learn self-acceptance. Many of us find a great deal of relief just from attending meetings, hearing fellow addicts share their stories, and discovering that others have felt the same way we feel about ourselves. When others share honestly with us who they are, we feel free to do the same. As we learn to tell others the truth about ourselves, we learn to accept ourselves. Self-disclosure, however, is only the beginning. Once we\u0027ve shared the things that make us uncomfortable with our lives, we need to find a different way to live--and that\u0027s where the steps come in. We develop a concept of a Higher Power. We inventory our lives, in detail, and discuss our inventory with our sponsor. We ask the God of our understanding to remove our character defects, the shortcomings that are the source of our troubles. We take responsibility for the things we\u0027ve done and make amends for them. And we incorporate all these disciplines into our daily lives, \"practicing these principles in all our affairs.\" By working the steps, we can become people we are proud to be. We can freely tell the truth about ourselves, for we have nothing to hide.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will walk the path to self-acceptance. I will show up, tell the truth, and work the steps.",
