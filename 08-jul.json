    "body":  "We\u0027ve heard it said that we often see God most clearly in one another. We see the truth of this when we practice our Twelfth Step. When we carry the recovery message to another addict, we sense the presence of a Power greater than ourselves. And as we watch the message take hold, we realize something else: It\u0027s the message that brings recovery, not the messenger. A Higher Power, not our own power, is the source of the change that begins when we carry the message to a still-suffering addict.As the message does its work, transforming the life of another addict, we see a Higher Power in action. We watch as acceptance and hope replace denial and despair. Before our very eyes, the first traces of honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness begin to appear. Something\u0027s happening inside this person, something bigger and more powerful than either of us.  We\u0027re watching the God we\u0027ve come to understand at work in someone\u0027s life.  We see the Higher Power in them.  And we know with greater certainty than ever that this Higher Power is in us, too, as the force driving our recovery.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: As I carry the message of recovery to other addicts, I will try to pay attention to the Power behind the message. Today, as I watch other addicts recover, I will try to recognize the God in them so I can better recognize the God in myself.",
