    "body":  "The longer we stay clean, the less surely we \"know\" what our Higher Power\u0027s will for us is--and the less it matters. Knowledge of our Higher Power\u0027s will becomes less a \"knowing\" thing and more a \"feeling\" thing. We still practice the Eleventh Step faithfully. But rather than look for \"signs\" from our Higher Power, we begin to rely more on our intuition, trusting our feelings about what will make us comfortable. After staying clean a few years, what we do seem to know is when we are acting against God\u0027s will for us. When we are going against God\u0027s will, we get that old uncomfortable feeling in our gut. That queasiness is a warning that, if we continue in this direction, ahead lie many sleepless nights. We need to pay attention to such feelings, for they are often signals that we are acting contrary to our Higher Power\u0027s will for us. Our Eleventh Step clearly states the true goal of prayer and meditation: improvement of our conscious contact with the God of our understanding, bringing us clearer knowledge of our Higher Power\u0027s will for us and the power to carry it out. We know God\u0027s will most clearly by how it feels, not by \"signs\" or words--and it feels right.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will pray for the knowledge of my Higher Power\u0027s will for me and the power to carry it out. I will pay attention to my feelings, and act when they feel right.",
