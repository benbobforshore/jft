    "body":  "When others approve of what we do or say, we feel good; when they disapprove, we feel bad. Their opinions of us, and how those opinions make us feel, can have positive value. By making us feel good about steering a straight course, they encourage us to continue doing so. \"People-pleasing\" is something else entirely. We \"people-please\" when we do things, right or wrong, solely to gain another person\u0027s approval. Low self-esteem can make us think we need someone else\u0027s approval to feel okay about ourselves. We do whatever we think it will take to make them tell us we\u0027re okay. We feel good for awhile. Then we start hurting. In trying to please another person, we\u0027ve diminished ourselves and our values. We realize that the approval of others will not fill the emptiness inside us. The inner satisfaction we seek can be found in doing the right things for the right reasons. We break the people-pleasing cycle when we stop acting merely to gain others\u0027 approval and start acting on our Higher Power\u0027s will for us. When we do, we may be pleasantly surprised to find that the people who really count in our lives will approve all the more of our behavior. Most importantly, though, we will approve of ourselves.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: Higher Power, help me live in accordance with spiritual principles. Only then can I approve of myself.",
