    "body":  "We need our fellow NA members--their experience, their friendship, their laughter, their guidance, and much, much more. Yet many of us hesitate to call our sponsor or visit our NA friends. We don\u0027t want to impose on them. We think about phoning someone, but we don\u0027t feel worthy of their time. We fear that if they ever got to know us--really know us--they\u0027d surely reject us. We forget that our fellow NA members are just like us. There\u0027s nothing we\u0027ve done, no place we\u0027ve been, no feeling we\u0027ve felt that other recovering addicts won\u0027t be able to identify with. The more we let others get to know us, the more we\u0027ll hear, \"You\u0027re in the right place. You\u0027re among friends. You belong. Welcome!\" We also forget that, just as we need others, they need us. We\u0027re not the only ones who want to feel like we belong, who want to experience the warmth of friendship, who want someone to share with. If we isolate ourselves from our fellow members, we deprive them of something they need, something only we can give them: our time, our company, our true selves. In Narcotics Anonymous, recovering addicts care for one another. What waits at the other end of the telephone is not rejection, but the love, warmth, and identification of the NA Fellowship. Make that call!",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: In NA, I am among friends. I will reach out to others, giving and receiving in fellowship.",
