    "body":  "Coping successfully with life\u0027s minor annoyances and frustrations is sometimes the most difficult skill we have to learn in recovery. We are faced with small inconveniences daily.  From untangling the knots in our children\u0027s shoelaces to standing in line at the market, our days are filled with minor difficulties that we must somehow deal with.If we\u0027re not careful, we may find ourselves dealing with these difficulties by bullying our way through each problem or grinding our teeth while giving ourselves a stern lecture about how we should handle them. These are extreme examples of poor coping skills, but even if we\u0027re not this bad there\u0027s probably room for improvement.Each time life presents us with another little setback to our daily plans, we can simply take a deep breath and talk to the God of our understanding.  Knowing that we can draw patience, tolerance, or whatever we need from that Power, we find ourselves coping better and smiling more often.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will take a deep breath and talk to my God whenever I feel frustrated.",
