    "body":  "Getting started on the Sixth and Seventh Steps isn\u0027t always easy. We may feel as though we have so much wrong with us that we are totally defective. We might feel like hiding under a rock. Under no circumstance would we want our fellow addicts to know about our inadequacies. We will probably go through a time of examining everything we say and do in order to identify our character defects and make sure we suppress them. We may look back at one particular day, cringing at what we\u0027re certain is the most embarrassing thing we\u0027ve ever said. We become determined to be rid of these horrible traits at all costs. But nowhere in the Sixth or Seventh Steps does it say we can learn to control our defects of character. In fact, the more attention we focus on them, the more firmly entrenched they will become in our lives. It takes humility to recognize that we can\u0027t control our defects any more than we can control our addiction. We can\u0027t remove our own defects; we can only ask a loving God to remove them. Letting go of something painful can be as difficult as letting go of something pleasant. But let\u0027s face it--holding on is a lot of work. When we really think about what we\u0027re holding onto, the effort just isn\u0027t worthwhile. It\u0027s time to let go of our character defects and ask God to remove them.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I\u0027m ready to have my defects removed. I will let go and allow a loving Higher Power to care for me.",
