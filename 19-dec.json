    "body":  "Tales of our antics in active addiction may be funny. Stories of our old bizarre reactions to life when using may be interesting. But they tend to carry the mess more than the message. Philosophical arguments on the nature of God are fascinating. Discussions of current controversies have their place--however, it\u0027s not at an NA meeting. Those times when we grow disgusted with meetings and find ourselves complaining that \"they don\u0027t know how to share\" or \"it was another whining session\" are probably indications that we need to take a good, hard look at how we share. What we share about how we got into recovery and how we stayed here through practicing the Twelve Steps is the real message of recovery. That\u0027s what we are all looking for when we go to a meeting. Our primary purpose is to carry the message to the still-suffering addict, and what we share at meetings can either contribute significantly to this effort or detract greatly. The choice, and the responsibility, is ours.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will share my recovery at an NA meeting.",
