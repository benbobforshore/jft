    "body":  "A negative attitude is the trademark of active addiction. Everything that occurred in our lives was someone or something else\u0027s fault. We had blaming others for our shortcomings down to a fine science. In recovery, one of the first things we strive to develop is a new attitude. We find that life goes a lot easier when we replace our negative thinking with positive principles. While a negative attitude dogged us in our active addiction, all too often it can follow us into the rooms of Narcotics Anonymous. How can we begin to adjust our attitudes? By altering our actions. It isn\u0027t easy, but it can be done. We can start by listening to the way we talk. Before we open our mouths, we ask ourselves some simple questions: Does what I\u0027m going to say speak to the problem, or the solution? Is what I\u0027m going to say framed in a kind manner? Is what I have to say important, or would everyone be just as well off if I kept my mouth shut? Am I talking just to hear myself talk, or is there some purpose to my \"words of wisdom\"? Our attitudes are expressed in our actions. Often, it\u0027s not what we say, but the way we say it, that really matters. As we learn to speak in a more positive manner, we will notice our attitudes improving as well.",
