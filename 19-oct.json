    "body":  "What a mixture of folks we have in Narcotics Anonymous! In any given meeting on any given night, we\u0027ll find a variety of people that probably never would have sat down in a room together if it weren\u0027t for the disease of addiction. A member who is a physician described his unwillingness to identify at his first meeting by refusing to go into \"that room full of junkies.\" Another member with an extensive background in jails and institutions shared a similar story, except that her shock and surprise stemmed from the realization that \"there were nice people there--wearing suits, yet!\" These two friends recently celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary. The most unlikely people form friendships, sponsor each other, and do service work together. We meet in the rooms of recovery together, sharing the bonds of past suffering and hope for the future. We meet on mutual ground with our focus on the two things we all have in common--addiction and recovery.",
