    "body":  "Life is a series of changes, both large and small. Although we may know and accept this fact intellectually, chances are that our initial emotional reaction to change is fear. For some reason, we assume that each and every change is going to hurt, causing us to be miserable. If we look back on the changes that have happened in our lives, we\u0027ll find that most of them have been for the best. We were probably very frightened at the prospect of life without drugs, yet it\u0027s the best thing that\u0027s ever happened to us. Perhaps we\u0027ve lost a job that we thought we\u0027d die without, but later on we found greater challenge and personal fulfillment in a new career. As we venture forth in our recovery, we\u0027re likely to experience more changes. We will outgrow old situations and become ready for new ones. With all sorts of changes taking place, it\u0027s only natural to grab hold of something, anything familiar and try to hold on. Solace can be found in a Power greater than ourselves. The more we allow changes to happen at the direction of our Higher Power, the more we\u0027ll trust that those changes are for the best. Faith will replace fear, and we\u0027ll know in our hearts that all will be well.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: When I am afraid of a change in my life, I will take comfort from knowing that God\u0027s will for me is good.",
