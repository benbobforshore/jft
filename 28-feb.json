    "body":  "When we begin coming to meetings, we hear other addicts talking about the gifts they have received as a result of this program, things we never thought of as \"gifts\" before. One such \"gift\" is the renewed ability to feel the emotions we had deadened for so long with drugs. It\u0027s not difficult to think of love, joy, and happiness as gifts, even if it\u0027s been a long time since we\u0027ve felt them. But what about \"bad\" feelings like anger, sadness, fear, and loneliness? Such emotions can\u0027t be seen as gifts, we tell ourselves. After all, how can we be thankful for things we want to run from?! We can become grateful for these emotions in our lives if we place them in their proper perspective. We need to remember that we\u0027ve come to believe in a loving Higher Power, and we\u0027ve asked that Power to care for us--and our Higher Power doesn\u0027t make mistakes. The feelings we\u0027re given, \"good\" or \"bad\" are given to us for a reason. With this in mind, we come to realize that there are no \"bad\" feelings, only lessons to be learned. Our faith and our Higher Power\u0027s care give us the courage we need to face whatever feelings may come up on a daily basis. As we heard early in recovery, \"Your Higher Power won\u0027t give you more than you can handle in just one day.\" And the ability to feel our emotions is one of the greatest gifts of recovery.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will try to welcome my feelings, firm in the belief that I have the courage to face whatever emotions may come up in my life.",
