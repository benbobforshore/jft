    "body":  "In our addiction we often treated others badly, sometimes deliberately finding ways to make their lives miserable. In our recovery, we may still have a tendency to pass judgment on others\u0027 actions because we think we know how that person should behave. But as we progress in our recovery we often find that, to accept ourselves, we must accept those around us. It may be difficult to watch as someone\u0027s insanity manifests itself. But if we detach ourselves from the problem, we can start living in the solution. And if we feel affected by another\u0027s actions, we can extend the principle of forgiveness.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will strive to forgive rather than be forgiven. I will try to act in such a way that I feel worthy of self-love.",
