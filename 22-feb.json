    "body":  "In Narcotics Anonymous, we\u0027ve found that the more we live in harmony with our Higher Power\u0027s will for us, the greater the harmony in our lives. We use the Tenth Step to help us maintain that harmony. On a daily basis, we take time to look at our behavior. Some of us measure each action with a very simple question: \"God\u0027s will, or mine?\" In many cases, we find that our actions have been in tune with our Higher Power\u0027s will for us, and we in turn have been in tune with the world around us. In some cases, however, we will discover inconsistencies between our behavior and our values. We\u0027ve been acting on our own will, not God\u0027s, and the result has been dissonance in our lives. When we discover such inconsistencies, we admit we\u0027ve been wrong and take corrective action. With greater awareness of what we believe God\u0027s will for us to be in such situations, we are less likely to repeat those actions. And we are more likely to live in greater concord with our Higher Power\u0027s will for us and with the world around us.",
