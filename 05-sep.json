    "body":  "As long as we still owe amends, our spirits are cluttered with things we don\u0027t need. We\u0027re carrying the extra load of an apology owed, a resentment held, or unexpressed remorse. It\u0027s like having a messy house. We could leave so we don\u0027t have to see the mess, or maybe just step over the piles of debris and pretend they aren\u0027t there. But ignoring the disorder won\u0027t make it disappear. In the end, the dirty dishes, the crumb-filled carpet, and the overflowing wastebaskets are still there, waiting to be cleaned up. A cluttered spirit is just as hard to live with as a messy home. We always seem to be tripping over yesterday\u0027s leavings. Every time we turn around and try to go somewhere, there is something blocking our path. The more we neglect our responsibility to make amends, the more cluttered our spirits become. And we can\u0027t even hire someone to clean up. We have to do the work ourselves. We gain a deep sense of satisfaction from making our own amends. Just as we would feel after we\u0027ve cleaned our homes and have time to enjoy a bit of sunshine through sparkling windows, so will our spirits rejoice at our freedom to truly enjoy our recovery. And once the big mess is cleaned up, all we have to do is pick up after ourselves as we go along.",
