    "body":  "Thoughts of how bad it was--or could be--can consume our hopes for recovery. Fantasies of how wonderful it was--or could be--can divert us from taking action in the real world. That\u0027s why, in Narcotics Anonymous, we talk about living and recovering \"just for today.\" In NA, we know that we can change. We\u0027ve come to believe that our Higher Power can restore the soundness of our minds and hearts. The wreckage of our past can be dealt with through the steps. By maintaining our recovery, just for today, we can avoid creating problems in the future. Life in recovery is no fantasy. Daydreams of how great using was or how we can use successfully in the future, delusions of how great things could be, overblown expectations that set us up for disappointment and relapse--all are stripped of their power by the program. We seek God\u0027s will, not our own. We seek to serve others, not ourselves. Our self-centeredness and the importance of how great things could or should be for us disappears. In the light of recovery, we perceive the difference between fantasy and reality.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I am grateful for the principles of recovery and the new reality they\u0027ve given me.",
