    "body":  "What are the two favorite words of most addicts? \"I know!\" Unfortunately, many of us arrive in NA thinking we have all the answers. We have a lot of knowledge about what\u0027s wrong with us. But in and of itself, knowledge never helped us stay clean for any length of time. Members who have achieved long-term recovery will be the first to admit that the longer they are here, the more they have to learn. But they do know one thing: By following this simple Twelve Step program, they have been able to stay clean. They no longer ask \"why\"; they ask \"how.\" The value of endless speculation pales in comparison to the experience of addicts who\u0027ve found a way to stay clean and live clean. This doesn\u0027t mean we don\u0027t ask \"why\" when it\u0027s appropriate. We don\u0027t come to NA and stop thinking! But in the beginning, it\u0027s often a very good idea to reword our questions. Instead of asking \"why,\" we ask \"how.\" How do I work this step? How often should I attend meetings? How do I stay clean?",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I don\u0027t have all the answers, but I know where to find the ones that matter. Today, I will ask another addict, \"How does it work?\"",
