    "body":  "Our spiritual condition is never static; if it\u0027s not growing, it\u0027s decaying. If we stand still, our spiritual progress will lose its upward momentum. Gradually, our growth will slow, then halt, then reverse itself. Our tolerance will wear thin; our willingness to serve others will wane; our minds will narrow and close. Before long, we\u0027ll be right back where we started: in conflict with everyone and everything around us, unable to bear even ourselves. Our only option is to actively participate in our program of spiritual growth. We pray, seeking knowledge greater than our own from a Power greater than ourselves. We open our minds and keep them open, becoming teachable and taking advantage of what others have to share with us. We demonstrate our willingness to try new ideas and new ways of doing things, experiencing life in a whole new way. Our spiritual progress picks up speed and momentum, driven by the Higher Power we are coming to understand better each day. Up or down--it\u0027s one or the other, with very little in between, where spiritual growth is concerned. Recovery is not fueled by wishing and dreaming, we\u0027ve discovered, but by prayer and action.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: The only constant in my spiritual condition is change. I cannot rely on yesterday\u0027s program. Today, I seek new spiritual growth through prayer and action.",
