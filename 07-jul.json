    "body":  "To say \"I\u0027m sorry\" probably isn\u0027t such a foreign idea to most of us. In our active addiction, it may have been a very familiar phrase. We were always telling people how sorry we were, and were probably deeply surprised when someone, tired of our meaningless apologies, responded with, \"You sure are. In fact, you\u0027re the sorriest excuse for...\"  That may have been our first clue that an \"I\u0027m sorry\" didn\u0027t really make any difference to those we harmed, especially when we both knew that we\u0027d just do the same thing again.Many of us thought that making amends would be another \"I\u0027m sorry.\"  However, the action we take in those steps is entirely different. Making amends means to make changes, and above all, to make the situation right. If we stole money, we don\u0027t just say \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ll never do it again now that I\u0027m clean.\" We pay the money back. If we neglected or abused our families, we don\u0027t just apologize. We begin to treat them with respect.Amending our behavior and the way we treat ourselves and others is the whole purpose of working the steps. We\u0027re no longer just \"sorry\"; we\u0027re responsible.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I accept responsibility for myself and my recovery. Today, I will amend some particular thing I\u0027m sorry for.",
