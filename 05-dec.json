    "body":  "By the time we came to NA, our inner voices had become unreliable and self-destructive. Addiction had warped our desires, our interests, our sense of what was best for ourselves. That\u0027s why it\u0027s been so important in recovery to develop our belief in a Power greater than ourselves, something that could provide saner, more reliable guidance than our own. We\u0027ve begun learning how to rely on this Power\u0027s care and to trust the inner direction it provides us. As with all learning processes, it takes practice to \"pray only for knowledge of God\u0027s will for us and the power to carry that out.\" The selfish, ego-driven attitudes we developed in our addiction are not cast off overnight. Those attitudes may affect the way we pray. We may even find ourselves praying something like, \"Relieve me of this character defect so I can look good.\" The more straightforward we are about our own ideas and desires, the easier it will be to distinguish between our own will and our Higher Power\u0027s will. \"Just for your information, God,\" we might pray, \"here\u0027s what I want in this situation. Nonetheless, I ask that your will, not mine, be done.\" Once we do this, we are prepared to recognize and accept our Higher Power\u0027s guidance.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: Higher Power, I\u0027ve learned to trust your guidance, yet I still have my own ideas about how I want to live my life. Let me share those ideas with you, and then let me clearly understand your will for me. In the end, let your will, not mine, be done.",
