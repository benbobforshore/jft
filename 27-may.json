    "body":  "Many of us have a hard time with the idea of a Higher Power until we fully accept the depth of our own powerlessness over addiction. Once we do, most of us are at least willing to consider seeking the help of some Power greater than our disease. The first practical exposure many of us have to that kind of Power is in the NA group. Perhaps that\u0027s where we should start in developing our own understanding of God. One evidence of the Power in the group is the unconditional love shown when NA members help one another without expectation of reward. The group\u0027s collective experience in recovery is itself a Power greater than our own, for the group has practical knowledge of what works and what doesn\u0027t. And the fact that addicts keep coming to NA meetings, day after day, is a demonstration of the presence of a Higher Power, some attractive, caring force at work that helps addicts stay clean and grow. All these things are evidence of a Power that can be found in NA groups. When we look around with an open mind, each of us will be able to identify other signs of that Power. It doesn\u0027t matter if we call it God, a Higher Power, or anything else--just as long as we find a way to incorporate that Power into our daily lives.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will open my eyes and my mind to signs of a Power that exists in my NA group. I will call upon that Power to help me stay clean.",
