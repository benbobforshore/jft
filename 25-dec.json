    "body":  "When we first come to Narcotics Anonymous meetings, we meet recovering addicts. We know they are addicts because they talk about the same experiences and feelings we\u0027ve had. We know they are recovering because of their serenity--they\u0027ve got something we want. We feel hope when other addicts share their recovery with us in NA meetings.The atmosphere of recovery attracts us to the meetings. That atmosphere is created when group members make a commitment to work together. We try to enhance the atmosphere of recovery by helping set up for meetings, greeting newcomers, and talking with other addicts after the meeting. These demonstrations of our commitment make our meetings attractive and help our groups share their recovery.Sharing experience in meetings is one way in which we help one another, and it\u0027s often the foundation for our sense of belonging. We identify with other addicts, so we trust their message of hope. Many of us would not have stayed in Narcotics Anonymous without that sense of belonging and hope. When we share at group meetings, we support our personal recovery while helping others.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I will reach out to another addict in my group and share my recovery.",
