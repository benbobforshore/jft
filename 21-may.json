    "body":  "Active addiction kept us isolated for many reasons. In the beginning, we avoided family and friends so they wouldn\u0027t find out we were using. Some of us avoided all nonaddicts, fearing moral backlash and legal repercussions. We belittled people who had \"normal\" lives with families and hobbies; we called them \"uncool,\" believing we could never enjoy the simple pleasures of life. Eventually, we even avoided other addicts because we didn\u0027t want to share our drugs. Our lives narrowed, and our concerns were confined to the daily maintenance of our disease. Today, our lives are much fuller. We enjoy activities with other recovering addicts. We have time for our families. And we\u0027ve discovered many other pursuits that give us pleasure. What a change from the past! We can live life just as fully as the \"normal\" people we once scorned. Enjoyment has returned to our lives, a gift of recovery.",
    "affirmation":  "Just for Today: I can find pleasure in the simple routines of daily living.",
